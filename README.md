This repository demonstrates a common issue in VBScript related to implicit type conversion during comparisons. The `bug.vbs` file contains code that showcases unexpected behavior when comparing values of different data types. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with explicit type checking or conversion to avoid ambiguity and ensure reliable comparison results.
